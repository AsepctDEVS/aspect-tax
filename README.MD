# Information

- Alv Development

Remember, this is a free script, so distribution is only allowed as long as it doesn't come with a cost! Just give me credit!

- What is this?

- This is a tax system for ESX which is fully configurable ranging from the time, the amount, the account and even if it is enabled!

# Installation

1 - Clone this repository
2 - Install this resource to your [esx] directory
3 - Add `start alv-tax` in your server.cfg or resources.cfg
4 - And you're done!

# Future

I will update this script as much as I can such as adding more capabilities for it and the ability for the amounts to differentiate based on xPlayer's job.
